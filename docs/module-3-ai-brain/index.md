# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book. This module explores how advanced perception, navigation, and training work in humanoid robots, with a focus on conceptual understanding of NVIDIA Isaac technologies.

## Overview

In this module, we'll examine how AI functions as the "brain" of humanoid robots, enabling them to perceive their environment, make decisions, and navigate complex spaces. We'll explore the role of NVIDIA Isaac in creating intelligent robotic systems that can operate in real-world environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How AI serves as the cognitive center of humanoid robots
- The importance of simulation and synthetic data generation in AI training
- Visual SLAM (VSLAM) concepts and their role in robot perception
- Navigation systems and path planning for humanoid robots
- Hardware acceleration benefits for real-time AI processing

## Chapter Structure

1. [Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim](./chapter-1-ai-brain.md) - Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
2. [VSLAM and Navigation with Isaac ROS](./chapter-2-isaac-sim.md) - Visual SLAM, localization, and sensor fusion concepts
3. [Path Planning with Nav2 for Humanoid Robots](./chapter-3-perception-navigation.md) - Navigation planning and obstacle avoidance
4. [Training and Perception Techniques](./chapter-5-training-perception.md) - Perception pipelines and training workflows

This module emphasizes conceptual understanding over implementation details, making it accessible to students with basic AI and robotics background knowledge.
