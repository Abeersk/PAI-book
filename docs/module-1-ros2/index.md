# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book. This module explores the communication infrastructure that enables complex robotic systems to function as coordinated wholes, focusing on the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the "nervous system" of modern robots.

## Overview

In this module, we'll examine how ROS 2 provides the essential communication backbone that allows different components of a robot to work together. We'll explore the middleware architecture, communication patterns, and how these systems enable the complex coordination required for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- The role of middleware in robotic systems and why it's essential for complex robots
- How ROS 2's publish-subscribe and client-server communication patterns work
- The relationship between ROS 2 and AI systems in robotic applications
- How to represent robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Chapter Structure

1. [Introduction to Middleware and the Robotic Nervous System](./chapter-1-middleware.md) - Understanding the communication backbone of robotics
2. [Nodes, Topics, and Services: The Building Blocks](./chapter-2-communication.md) - Core ROS 2 communication concepts
3. [Bridging AI and Robotics](./chapter-3-ai-bridge.md) - Connecting AI systems with robotic hardware
4. [Robot Modeling with URDF](./chapter-4-urdf.md) - Representing robot structure and kinematics

This module emphasizes conceptual understanding over implementation details, making it accessible to students with basic AI and robotics background knowledge.
