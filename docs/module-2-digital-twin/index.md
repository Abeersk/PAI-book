# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book. This module explores digital twin technologies for robotics, focusing on simulation environments that enable the development and testing of AI-driven robotic systems.

## Overview

In this module, we'll examine how digital twin technologies create virtual replicas of physical robots and environments, enabling safe and efficient development of robotic systems. We'll explore both physics-based simulation (Gazebo) and visualization-focused approaches (Unity) for creating comprehensive digital representations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- What digital twin technology is and its role in robotics
- How Gazebo provides physics-based simulation for robotics
- How Unity enables advanced visualization and user interaction
- The integration of sensor simulation in digital environments
- The benefits of digital twins for robot development and testing
