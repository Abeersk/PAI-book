# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book. This module explores the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Robotics, focusing on how human intent is translated into physical robot actions through Vision-Language-Action systems.

## Overview

In this module, we'll examine how Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems enable humanoid robots to understand human commands and execute them in physical space. We'll explore the integration of perception, language understanding, and motion planning that allows robots to respond to natural language instructions in complex environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How Vision-Language-Action systems integrate perception, language, and action
- The process of translating voice commands into robot actions
- How Large Language Models plan and sequence tasks for humanoid robots
- The end-to-end workflow of autonomous humanoid systems
- The role of embodied AI in creating responsive robotic systems

## Chapter Structure

1. [Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](./chapter-1-vla-intro.md) - Understanding the VLA framework and its importance
2. [Voice-to-Action – From Speech to Robot Intent](./chapter-2-voice-to-action.md) - Processing voice commands and extracting intent
3. [Cognitive Planning with Large Language Models](./chapter-3-cognitive-planning.md) - Task planning and decision-making with LLMs
4. [Capstone – The Autonomous Humanoid Workflow](./chapter-4-capstone.md) - Complete end-to-end workflow demonstration

This module emphasizes conceptual understanding over implementation details, making it accessible to students with basic AI and robotics background knowledge.
