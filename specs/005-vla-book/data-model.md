## State Transitions

### VLA System States
- **IDLE**: Awaiting user input
- **LISTENING**: Processing audio input
- **UNDERSTANDING**: Analyzing command and context
- **PLANNING**: Generating action sequence
- **EXECUTING**: Performing planned actions
- **COMPLETED**: Task finished successfully
- **FAILED**: Task execution unsuccessful
- **SAFETY_STOP**: Emergency stop due to safety concern

**Valid Transitions**:
- IDLE → LISTENING (user speaks)
- LISTENING → UNDERSTANDING (audio processed)
- UNDERSTANDING → PLANNING (intent recognized)
- PLANNING → EXECUTING (plan validated)
- EXECUTING → COMPLETED (task finished)
- EXECUTING → FAILED (execution error)
- ANY → SAFETY_STOP (safety violation detected)
- FAILED/SAFETY_STOP → IDLE (reset/restart)

### Task Plan States
- **PENDING**: Plan created but not yet started
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being executed
- **PAUSED**: Temporarily stopped (e.g., obstacle detected)
- **COMPLETED**: Successfully finished
- **FAILED**: Could not be completed
- **CANCELLED**: Aborted before completion

**Valid Transitions**:
- PENDING → IN_PROGRESS (execution starts)
- IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED (successful finish)
- IN_PROGRESS → FAILED (execution error)
- IN_PROGRESS → PAUSED (temporary stop)
- PAUSED → IN_PROGRESS (resume)
- ANY → CANCELLED (user interruption)
